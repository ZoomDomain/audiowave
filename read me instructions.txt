Run the unity file
The .js code will upload an mp3 file into the graphics card. 10mb is 1 minute of audio. 
the graphics card will display the audio file as per the graphing positions in the shader. 
you can re-code and position the x/y offset and zoom value in the shader only, else add some variables to adjust from cs/js. 

The shader does not resize the audio graph when you change the screen size, it is 768 pixels long on any sized screen. you have to include a screen res. multiplier into the shader for that. 

The color is at the end of the shader, i.e. .8.8.8 is white. 

the skipn value of the shader zooms by telling the shader to graph every 20th audio bit or every 50th etc. 

the three buffer lists in the shader are: a vertex , every of the audio file is a vertex line.... the audio bit amplitudes... the audio bit positions? something? from 4 years ago.
